- Have a way to define your default stack rather than on Vlad.load rather than
  having it checked into git
  (perhaps not have a default stack and only define on load).

- What I want is to have the same deployment tasks for any application, whether
  it is a rails, merb, or standalone ruby app, etc., using activerecord,
  datamapper, etc., and running via passenger, mongrel, god, daemonize,
  whatever. It would look like this:

# For a new deployment:
# - rake vlad:setup
# - rake vlad:upload_config FILES=database.yml
# - rake vlad:update
# - rake vlad:migrate
# - rake vlad:start:first_time
#
# For redeploys:
# - rake vlad:deploy
#   (runs vlad:stop, vlad:update, vlad:start, vlad:cleanup)
# - rake vlad:deploy:migrations
#   (runs vlad:stop, vlad:update, vlad:migrate, vlad:start, vlad:cleanup)
